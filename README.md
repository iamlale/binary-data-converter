# binary-data-converter
in this project, i implemented an application, in Java programming
language; that takes
• a file containing numbers
• the byte ordering type (Little Endian or Big Endian),
• the data type to be converted, and
• the size of the floating point data type (the size of both signed and
unsigned integers are 2 bytes),
